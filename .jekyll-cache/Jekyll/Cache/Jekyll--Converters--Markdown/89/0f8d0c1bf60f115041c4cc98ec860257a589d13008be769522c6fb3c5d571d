<p>The Global AI Community empowers developers who are passionate about AI to share knowledge through events and meetups. We host 3 global AI events across 100 locations that span every corner of the globe. We also provide a variety of resources to members of the community, including a free Meetup Pro account for user groups, event-in-a-box content, Azure passes, and support for booking Microsoft venues. We work closely with product teams at Microsoft to share workshop content about the newest Azure AI products.</p>
